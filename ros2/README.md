# ROS2 C++ Sketch

This folder intentionally contains a small C++ ROS2 node sketch to demonstrate
that the project can be extended from pure simulation code to an online control loop.

For a production-ready ROS2 package, add:
- `package.xml`
- `CMakeLists.txt`
- proper interfaces (`std_msgs` or custom messages)
- launch files and integration tests
